Obviously not going to work like this but we'll see.

I want a command line argument in which I can use the following tool

# Transport
to [directory]

which will take care of 
'cd /full/path/to/directory/'

if there is any sort of conflict of interest, what will happen is that 

""
Where to?
[1] /one/path/
[2] /two/path/
[3] /three/path/
"""

Or if there's nothing

[Invalid directory]



# Add

I can use to -a 'name' 

Simply adds it to an index file located in 
/Users/blz/.whereto



# Edit
Edit will simply open the index and will be able to be customized so you can remove the file and go on with your life. Alternatively we can do a simple

to -x 'name'

which will print

[Invalid directory]

'
Which one?
[1] .././.
[2] /./.
'

or 
[name] removed. 




# Future?
Add support for names, so I can cd to a directory like 'oops' and it'll know where to.
Make sure names are unique.
